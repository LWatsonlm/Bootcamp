Hey you! You made it. You made the journey with me to the last final week of class and the big Project 4 finale. It's been a long road and now it's almost time to say goodbye. This week, our instructors provided two elective classes, an Instructor AMA (Ask Me Anything, famous from Reddit) and Project 4 Presentations were due. On the very last day of class, we reflected with our classmates, pop champagnge and discussed life after WDI with the Outcomes team. Let's go!

# Day 1: One on Ones and Independent Project Work

Today, we didn't have anything else to do but work, work, work, work, work. An instructor was available to answer any questions from 1:30pm - 2:30pm, exactly one hour of the day. Otherwise, all questions were to be submitted as Github Issues on the general project repo.

# Day 2: Project Work and Intro to React Native

Again, an intructor was available for one hour of the day. All issues or questions were to be submitted through Github as an issue. Luckily, the instructors were very quick to response to issues and provide help online. Also, as a class, we helped each other a lot through difficult bugs. It's really impressive to see how far everyone has come in their journey of learning to programming. I was truly lucky to have such an amazing cohort, full of bright, helpful and eager individuals.

Okay, enough of the sappy talk.

## Intro to React Native: 2.5 Hours

React Native is a framework for building cross-platform apps. React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. This lesson only covered iOS development, that once learned, can be ported into creating an Android app very quickly.

Unfortunetly, I did not attend this elective. I didn't think my brain could handle any more new information and I was too focused on my project to even get up and take a bathroom break. But I'll share with you the learning objectives.

## Learning Objectives:

* Explain the problem React Native solves and its approach to solving it
* Build an iOS app with React Native
* Utilize ```Text```, ```View```, ```ListView```, ```Image``` and ```TextInput``` components to construct native screens
* Explain how to style componets in a React Native application

# Day 3: Project Work and Custom Deployment

All morning was all work and barely any play. In the afternoon, our offical last class was available as an elective: Custom Deployment.

## Custom Deployment: 2.5 Hours

Today, I was feeling good about the progress I've made in my project so I decided to give myself a break and learn about custom deployments! So far in class, we've deployed our apps using Heroku, Github Pages and Firebase. Today, we learned how to deploy our apps using Digital Ocean.

## Learning Objectives:

* Create a Digital Ocean droplet
* Log into a server via SSH
* Install dependencies on a server
* Install a webserver
* Clone an application to a Virtual Private Server (VPS)
* Set up a domain and proxy server
* Configure a reverse proxy

So, if you're like me, you might be asking yourself, "Heroku worked just fine... why learn something new?". With Heroku, deploying to Heroku requires a very specific configuration and customization is very limited.  With Digital Ocean, you have customization, you can install whatever dependecies you want - whether it's gems, npm modules, etc. So, it's worth getting an understanding for when we start building bigger apps, with more dependecies and need the flexiblity.

So as a class, we registered for a Digital Ocean account and walked through the learning objectives together.

One notable thing, it was my first time actually using ```nginx```. I've seen that word before but today I found out it's a web server. Most popular for being fast with low memory usage and that it can act as a reverse proxy server. You can easily install it using the command line:

```$ sudo apt-get install nginx```

You'll know nginx is up and running if you see something like this...

Cool.

# Day 4: Instructors AMA
