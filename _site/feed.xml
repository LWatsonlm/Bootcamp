				<title>Is Coding Bootcamp Right For You? Life During Coding Bootcamp</title>

&lt;img scr=&quot;~/img/latoyawatson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I embarked on a new journey to become a web developer through a full-time coding bootcamp. It took me a long time to decide (like a year!) if a coding bootcamp was right for me. I had a hard time finding resources from first-hand experiences from students, and there’s definitely not a lot of week-to-week recaps of what exactly goes on at these camps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m starting a weekly recap of my experiences for anyone and everyone who is thinking of joining a coding bootcamp. I’ll be posting my weekly recaps every Sunday. I hope it helps someone out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-coding-bootcamp-anyway&quot;&gt;What is a Coding Bootcamp, Anyway?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding bootcamps seems to be all the talk in the tech world right now. There are over 70 in-person bootcamps throughout the US and Canada and I’m sure that number is growing. A coding bootcamp is a technical training program lasting anywhere from 8-14 weeks and is designed as a fast-paced, immersive, full-time career accelerator program. Coding bootcamps claim they can teach people with little to no coding experience how to write code, build applications and change careers into web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_20160906_155133.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;first day of class&quot; /&gt;
First day of class, we sat alphabetical  order, so I had a last row seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-did-i-decide-to-join-a-full-time-coding-bootcamp&quot;&gt;Why Did I Decide to Join a Full-time Coding Bootcamp&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in technology all my adult life. I graduated with a B.S in Information Technology, worked for a Fortune 200 company, found out I hated corporate life and moved to D.C., worked as tech support and most recently, a tech and data strategist for a clean energy nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been interested in coding since college, but I’ve always felt that I wasn’t  smart enough to learn how to code (mainly thanks to patriarchy and systemic racism – another story for another time). In the past two years, I’ve tried learning code at my own pace online at places like Codeacademy or at in-person events in D.C., such as the well-respected Hear Me Code community. While both options helped me with the fundamentals, I wanted more. I knew it was time to dedicate my time to making my dream job come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I applied and was accepted into General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive Program (WDI) within their 12th WDI cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_20160906_131357.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;welcome to wdi12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-will-i-be-learning-these-next-12-weeks&quot;&gt;So what will I be learning these next 12 weeks?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technologies-the-wdi-program-covers&quot;&gt;Technologies the WDI program covers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS / SASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL (Relational Database)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MongoDB (NoSQL Database)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node.js / Express&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angular.js&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have experience with HTML/CSS and Python but that’s it. I’m extremely excited for this line up of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note, this program iterates on this curriculum constantly. Technologies, concepts, etc, change with each cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this first post is an introductory post. Please check back next week for my post of my first week at General Assembly. Chat soon!&lt;/p&gt;
