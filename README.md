# About Tech Eats:

Tech Eats is my blog recapping stories of food, travel, and tech. Featuring my series documenting my journey through a full-time coding bootcamp in Washington, D.C, entitled: "Is Coding Bootcamp Right for You? A Week in The Life of a Coding Bootcamper"

# "Is Coding Bootcamp Right for You? A Week in The Life of a Coding Bootcamper"

In September, I embarked on a new journey to become a web developer through a full-time coding bootcamp. It took me a long time to decide if a coding bootcamp was right for me. I had a hard time finding resources from first-hand experiences from students, and thereâ€™s definitely not a lot of week-to-week recaps of what exactly goes on at these camps.

So, I started a weekly recap of my experiences with General Assembly for anyone and everyone who is thinking of joining a coding bootcamp. I hope it helps someone out there.

# Important Things I Learned While Building a Site Using Jekyll

## Front Matter, Matters.

Every single post needs to have a Front Matter or else it just won't work. Front Matters come with all types of options, and example of my Front Matter for my posts:

```md
---
layout: post
title:  "Is Coding Bootcamp Right for You? Week 8 in The Life of a Coding Bootcamper"
date:   2016-11-06
description: "Last week was Project 2 week... this week, we talk APIs, AJAX, Building our own API, Firebase and the introduction to Project 3. Let's go!"
categories: [coding-bootcamp]
tags: [API, AJAX, angular]
---
```

Important to note: How the markdown files get served also varies depending on the ```_config.yml``` file.

## _site folder

Do NOT modify or add anything to the ```_site``` folder! This is the rendering folder for Jekyll and any modification will be eliminated without warning. I spent my entire first day using Jekyll wondering why none of my styles were rendering! ðŸ˜…

## Localhost vs. Live on Github Pages

This has been my biggest lesson for sure. GitHub Pages is deeply integrated with Jekyll, but for some reason, Jekyll's relative paths donâ€™t work on GitHub Pages.

 Meaning, once you deploy, **all** the image links and styling will not work. You need to update all the relative paths and images paths for everything to render properly on GH-Pages.

The problem is that Jekyll assumes that your site lives at the root URL ```(i.e. username.github.io)```, when it is in fact in ```username.github.io/project-name```.

The solution is well documented by [Matt Swensen](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332#issuecomment-18952908):

In ```_config.yml```, set the baseurl option to ```/project-name``` -- note the leading slash and the absence of a trailing slash.

Now you'll need to change the way you do links in your templates and posts, in the following two ways:

When referencing JS or CSS files, do it like this:
```{{ site.baseurl }}/path/to/css.css```
-- note the slash immediately following the variable (just before "path").

When doing permalinks or internal links, do it like this:
```{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}```
-- note that there is no slash between the two variables.

Finally, if you'd like to preview your site before committing/deploying using ```jekyll serve```, be sure to pass an empty string to the ```--baseurl``` option, so that you can view everything at ```localhost:4000``` normally (without /project-name getting in there to muck everything up):
```jekyll serve --baseurl ''```

This way you can preview your site locally from the site root on localhost, but when GitHub generates your pages from the gh-pages branch all the URLs will start with /project-name and resolve properly.

I'd like to note that I found my pictures inside my posts were coming back with 404, so I needed to update my post's links to use Liquid markup language:

```md
![welcome]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/IMG_20160906_131357.jpg)
```
